# Diwali_Sales_Analysis

This dataset contains sales data for a retail store during the Diwali festival period in India. The data includes information on the products sold, their categories, the sales channels, the dates and times of sale, the sale prices, and the quantities sold.

This project demonstrates the use of Python and Power BI to culminate the aspects of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and BI (Business Intelligence) to harness insights into sales during the Diwali market across various states of India.
